# RootFinder

## Overview
This project contains five distinct files, each dedicated to one of the mathematical root-finding methods: Bisection, Newton, Modified Newton, and Secant. Additionally, there is a file that houses our main menu. Essential mathematical operations within these files are efficiently managed using the SymPy and/or NumPy libraries.

## Main

The main menu file, which also acts as our primary execution point, begins by prompting the user to input a function in terms of  x. Following this, the user is presented with a selection of methods to determine the root of the provided function. There's also an exit option available. Once a method is chosen, the program will request the user to input necessary parameters for problem-solving, such as the maximum number of iterations, tolerance, among others.
Beyond simply providing the user with results, our program offers a feature to visualize the obtained data. This is achieved using the matplotlib.pyplot library.
